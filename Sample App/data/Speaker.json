  "bio": "David is a geek, and it shows. He first became interested in framework development working for Microsoft's Silverlight team, where he gained a healthy appreciation for the nuances of building software for other developers to consume. After working on Google's Chrome team, David found his way to Parse, bringing him right back to the developer-facing world he had grown to love.\n\nIn addition to David's work for the tech giants, David has found ways to combine mobile development with his hobbies, building a few successful apps for Android and Windows Phone that serve the a cappella and barbershop singing communities. His app development ultimately led him to Parse, and once he saw what they were up to, he had to become involved.\n\nDavid is a Siebel Scholar and graduate with high honors from UC Berkeley, holding a B.A. and an M.Sc. in Computer Science.",

Recently he's done some mobile development at Facebook and at Coffee and Power. In general he loves working on platform products that enable other developers to make awesome stuff. He has quite a few unfinished breadboarding projects, likes sketching people, and brews a bit of beer and hard cider on the side.\n\nBrad graduated with honors from Harvard University with a concentration in Computer Science.",
