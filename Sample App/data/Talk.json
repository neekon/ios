Developers use these API building blocks to move faster than ever to create applications that their customers love. Complex business applications, that in years past might have taken large teams months to create, can now be developed by a single person in a matter of days.\n\nIn this presentation, we will focus on how one such application, the call center, can be developed and deployed without provisioning a server, setting up a database, or even hiring a dedicated back end developer. We'll begin by breaking down the requirements of a call center application (http://www.twilio.com/solutions/call-centers), and designing the solution using Twilio and Parse/Cloud Code. We'll then do a demo and code walkthrough of a call center application that connects agents to customers dialing in from anywhere directly in the browser.\n\nSoftware people like you are building the future of human interaction, at a blistering pace, with new tools like Twilio and Parse. I hope you'll join us to learn more about how it's done!",
